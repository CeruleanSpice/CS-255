# Course: CS-255: System Analysis and Design
## Student: Breeanna Hairston


Welcome to the repository for my coursework in CS-255 at Southern New Hampshire University. This course focuses on systems analysis and design, emphasizing communication with stakeholders, the use of UML diagrams, and the creation of clear documentation for technical and nontechnical audiences.

## üß† Skills Gained

Throughout this course, I developed the following key skills:
- Requirements elicitation and documentation
- UML diagram creation and interpretation
- Effective communication with technical and nontechnical audiences
- System modeling and design thinking

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- Lucidchart (for UML diagrams)
- Draw.io
- Microsoft Word & Excel
- Visual Studio Code (for notes and organization)
- GitHub (version control)

## Projects Included:
Project One: Business Requirements Document
Project Two: System Design Document

#Overview
This portfolio submission highlights my ability to analyze a business need and design a suitable software solution. These documents demonstrate key skills in requirement gathering, user-centered design, and system modeling.

##DriverPass Project Summary
The DriverPass project was centered around designing a cloud-based system for a fictional company that provides driving instruction through online and in-person services. The client, DriverPass, needed a system to streamline and support various services including scheduling classroom sessions, administering online tests, managing behind-the-wheel lessons, tracking student progress, and processing payments.

My role was to gather the business requirements from the client and create a full system design that would meet those needs in a scalable, user-friendly, and efficient way.

##What I Did Well
One area I feel I did particularly well in was clearly identifying and organizing business requirements. I made sure to translate vague or high-level needs into structured, actionable goals that could be tracked and validated through system functionality. I also developed well-labeled UML diagrams and considered both the user and administrative perspectives, which ensured a more complete system design.

##What I Would Revise
If I were to revise any part of my work, I would focus on making the system limitations and future scalability planning more robust in the system design document. I initially emphasized what the system could do, but with more time, I would flesh out what it couldn‚Äôt do in its initial release and explain a clear path for adding more advanced features like AI-assisted scheduling or mobile app integration.

##Implementing User Needs
To interpret the user‚Äôs needs, I carefully analyzed the client‚Äôs goals from the prompt and considered the workflows of students, instructors, and administrators. I mapped out the expected user interactions and ensured that every component‚Äîfrom the user interface to back-end data storage‚Äîreflected those needs. This included use cases for booking lessons, viewing test results, and issuing reminders.

Considering user needs is essential because software is only as valuable as it is usable. Ignoring users can lead to poorly adopted systems, confusion, and even financial losses. By placing user experience at the center of the design, I ensured the solution would be both functional and intuitive.

##My Design Approach
My design approach includes the following steps:

Understand the problem thoroughly ‚Äì Start with business needs and user stories.

Break the system into modules ‚Äì Identify logical groupings such as scheduling, payments, and progress tracking.

Use visual modeling tools ‚Äì UML diagrams help both technical and nontechnical stakeholders understand the system.

Keep iterating ‚Äì Good design is refined through feedback and usability analysis.

In the future, I plan to implement more collaborative design sessions, including stakeholder interviews or feedback loops, and also incorporate tools like Lucidchart, Figma, and ER modeling platforms for better visualization and user flow testing.
